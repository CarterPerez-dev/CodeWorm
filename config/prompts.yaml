# CodeWorm Prompt Templates
# Customize how the LLM generates documentation

# Documentation style: technical, casual, or detailed
style: technical

# System prompt - sets the LLM's persona and rules
system_prompt: |
  You are a technical documentation writer analyzing code snippets.

  Your task is to write clear, concise documentation that explains:
  - What the code does (the "what")
  - Why it matters or when to use it (the "why")
  - Any notable patterns, trade-offs, or gotchas

  Rules:
  1. Only reference code that exists in the provided snippet
  2. Do not invent or assume external functionality
  3. Be specific - mention actual variable/function names
  4. Keep explanations under 200 words
  5. Use markdown formatting
  6. Focus on practical understanding, not line-by-line description

# Main documentation template
# Available variables: {language}, {source}, {name}, {file_path}, {repo}, {complexity}, {line_count}
documentation_template: |
  Analyze and document this {language} code:

  ```{language}
  {source}
  ```

  Context:
  - Function/Class: {name}
  - File: {file_path}
  - Repository: {repo}
  - Complexity: {complexity} (cyclomatic)
  - Lines: {line_count}

  Write technical documentation (100-200 words) covering:
  1. Purpose and behavior
  2. Key implementation details
  3. When/why to use this code
  4. Any patterns or gotchas worth noting

# Commit message generation template
# Available variables: {documentation}, {name}, {language}, {repo}
commit_message_template: |
  Based on this documentation snippet, generate a natural-sounding git commit message.

  Documentation:
  {documentation}

  Code context:
  - Function: {name}
  - Language: {language}
  - Repository: {repo}

  Generate a commit message that:
  - Starts with a verb (Document, Add, Analyze, etc)
  - Is under 72 characters
  - Sounds natural, not robotic
  - Mentions the function/concept name

  Return ONLY the commit message, nothing else.

  typescript: "Note TypeScript-specific types, generics, and async patterns"
  tsx: "Cover React component patterns, hooks usage, and prop types"
  javascript: "Highlight async/await patterns, closures, and module patterns"
  go: "Emphasize Go idioms like error handling, goroutines, and interfaces"
  rust: "Focus on ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and Result/Option patterns"
